\title{Create a Processed Version of the Ames Housing Data}
\usage{
make_ames()

make_ordinal_ames()
}
\value{
A tibble with the data.

\description{
Create a Processed Version of the Ames Housing Data
}
\details{
For the processed version, the exact details can be found in
the code of \code{make_ames} but a summary of the differences between
these data sets and \code{ames_raw} is:
\itemize{
\item All factors are \emph{unordered}.
\item \code{PID} and \code{Order} are removed.
\item Spaces and special characters in column names where changed
to snake case. To be consistent, \code{SalePrice} was changed to
\code{Sale_Price}.
\item One row was removed with an unexplained missing value.
\item Many factor levels were changed to be more understandable
(e.g. \code{Split_or_Multilevel} instead of \code{080})
\item Many missing values were reset. For example, if the variable
\code{Bsmt_Qual} was missing, this implies that there is no basement
on the property. Instead of a missing value, the value of
\code{Bsmt_Qual} was changed to \code{No_Basement}. Similarly, numeric
data pertaining to basements were set to zero where appropriate
such as variables \code{Bsmt_Full_Bath} and \code{Total_Bsmt_SF}.
\item \code{Garage_Yr_Blt} contained many missing data and was removed.
\item Approximate longitude and latitude are included for 2,911
properties. By default, the processed data returns these
instances since their parcel IDs can be found in the Iowa
system. This eliminated one neighborhood, Green Hills, from the
processed data. Also, note that there are 7 properties with
identical geotags. These are units within the same building.
}

\code{make_ordinal_ames} is the same as \code{make_ames} but many factor
variables were changed to class \code{ordered} (see below).
